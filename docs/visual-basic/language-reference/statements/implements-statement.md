# <a name="implements-statement"></a>Istruzione Implements
Specifies one or more interfaces, or interface members, that must be implemented in the class or structure definition in which it appears.  
  
## <a name="syntax"></a>Sintassi  
  
```vb  
Implements interfacename [, ...]  
' -or-  
Implements interfacename.interfacemember [, ...]  
```  
  
## <a name="parts"></a>Parti  
 `interfacename`  
 Obbligatorio. An interface whose properties, procedures, and events are to be implemented by corresponding members in the class or structure.  
  
 `interfacemember`  
 Obbligatorio. The member of an interface that is being implemented.  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>Note  
 An interface is a collection of prototypes representing the members (properties, procedures, and events) the interface encapsulates. Interfaces contain only the declarations for members; classes and structures implement these members. Per altre informazioni, vedere [Interfacce](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md).  
  
 The `Implements` statement must immediately follow the `Class` or `Structure` statement.  
  
 When you implement an interface, you must implement all the members declared in the interface. Omitting any member is considered to be a syntax error. To implement an individual member, you specify the [Implements](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-clause.md) keyword (which is separate from the `Implements` statement) when you declare the member in the class or structure. Per altre informazioni, vedere [Interfacce](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md).  
  
 Classes can use [Private](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md) implementations of properties and procedures, but these members are accessible only by casting an instance of the implementing class into a variable declared to be of the type of the interface.  
  
## <a name="example"></a>Esempio  
 The following example shows how to use the `Implements` statement to implement members of an interface. It defines an interface named `ICustomerInfo` with an event, a property, and a procedure. The class `customerInfo` implements all the members defined in the interface.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#33](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#33)]  
  
 Note that the class `customerInfo` uses the `Implements` statement on a separate source code line to indicate that the class implements all the members of the `ICustomerInfo` interface. Then each member in the class uses the `Implements` keyword as part of its member declaration to indicate that it implements that interface member.  
  
## <a name="example"></a>Esempio  
 The following two procedures show how you could use the interface implemented in the preceding example. To test the implementation, add these procedures to your project and call the `testImplements` procedure.
